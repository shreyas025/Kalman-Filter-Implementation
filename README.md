# Kalman-Filter-Implementation
This project demonstrates the application of Kalman Filters in a simple 2D tracking scenario and can be used as a reference for more complex implementations.

The output will generate a plot showing the comparison between ground truth states, simulated noisy measurements, and the Kalman Filter's estimates
